# Transfromage
An multi-threaded event-based API for Transformice. Uses an online API endpoint so you don't need to set the encryption keys

# API Endpoint
This API uses an endpoint that gives you access to the Transformice encryption keys. All you need to start the bot is just to execute the Client.start(api_tfmid, api_token) function and it will start the entire bot.
The API endpoint is [this one](https://api.tocu.tk/get_transformice_keys.php) and you need to request access to Tocutoeltuco (preferably via discord: Tocutoeltuco#0018) and explain your project.
